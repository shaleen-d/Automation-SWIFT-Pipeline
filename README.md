# Transform SWIFT messages to printable Word documents
The GUI application processes SWIFT MT 202 messages and converts them to printable word document format. The lines and columns on each page can be customised.

The program takes the daily file downloaded from SWIFT system and sorts through the SWIFT messages by counterparty and reference number, removes MT950 messages and arranges the messages into a print ready document.
